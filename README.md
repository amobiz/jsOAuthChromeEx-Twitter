# A Sample of jsOAuth plugin for Google Chrome Extension for Twitter

This sample uses the following libraries:
* [jsOAuth](https://bytespider.github.com/jsOAuth/), and
* [jsOAuth plugin for Google Chrome Extension](https://github.com/amobiz/jsOAuthChromeEx/).

## Howto

You'll need to create an account on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).

And then "[Create New App](https://apps.twitter.com/)".

Make sure the Callback URL field has a valid value (for chrome extension, this url is not invoked).

Fill in the `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret` in the form on option page.
(Normally you will put these keys directly somewhere in your code.)
